- 1/10/2014: 
  - Reduced host-side memory use by about 500MB (allocated, not actively used).
  - Slight improvements to some output
  - Speed boost to SHA512 should improve hash rates on quite a few platforms.
    In some cases, *substantially*.
  - Added an easy-to-configure 1% dev fee.  If you're interested in this,
    see main_poolminer.cpp in the "donation_addrs" list.  If you've added a
    port to a platform or are releasing a binary for others, this provides an
    easy way to share in the dev fee while still feeding some of it back upstream
    to other developers.  This is an experiment in keeping the source free and open
    while creating an incentive for everyone to develop good software.

   First release
